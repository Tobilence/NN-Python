# Neural Network in Python

Beginner project to understand basic neural networks from the ground up. No external libraries were used (with exception for numpy, for math operations).

This Repo contains fundamental building blocks of a neural network:
 - Dense & Dropout Layers
 - Activation Functions (Sigmoid, ReLU)
 - Loss Functions (MSE, MAE, Categorical- & Binary Crossentropy)
 - Optimizers (Adam, SGD)
 - Model object (encapsulating the process of training & testing)

The purpose of creating this repository was, to understand the math behind neural networks. This will be the basis for more advanced AI project in my future, as I learned the impact each hyperparameter might have on a network, and began to learn to tweak them accordingly.

To demonstrate & verify the neural network, I included a script that learns to classify Zalando images. More info's about this problem & dataset are accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).
